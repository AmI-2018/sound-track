  <p>This system would allow for whatever a user is listening to (such as music and podcasts) to follow them around their house or flat. Sound Track would be for those who have a variety of audio equipment and want to seamlessly utilize it while going about their activities at home. It would keep track of where the user is and play their audio on the nearest available speaker system. This system would also be able to intelligently handle multiple users moving around and control volume in situations when there are other residents that shouldn’t be disturbed (such as phone calls or sleeping). Sound Track would be compatible with most audio sources and speaker systems and utilize other devices, such as smartphones, when no dedicated system is available.  The system would have an interface that provides controls for initial setup, preferences, notifications explaining why an action was automatically performed with the option to override, and active controls such as volume and possibly standard media controls (i.e. previous track, next track, pause/play, etc.).</p>

  <h3 id="purpose-and-scope">Purpose and Scope</h3>
  <p> The goal of the system is to improve the user experience of listening to audio content while moving through various areas of their living space. Sound Track accomplishes this by routing the output(s) of existing audio sources to existing audio outputs such that the user is able to move freely around their living space while enjoying a seamless listening experience.</p>
  <p> Sound Track is meant to stream existing audio output from other applications and devices and route to other existing speakers and devices. It is not the media player software nor the speaker.</p>

    <p>Location beacons/trackers. Stationary components for locating users in living space. </p>
    <p>Supported existing audio playback devices (i.e. speakers). Receives and plays audio from Central Server.</p>
    <p>Supported existing audio sources. Sends audio to Central Server.</p>
    <p>On-person tracking (may be the same as audio source, also potentially optional). Mobile component for locating users in living space.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Software</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>WebApp control panel for playback preference management. Runs on Central Server. User interacts through mobile or computer device. Interacts with system via a preference database.</p>
    <p>Database Management System for user(s) settings regarding music playback and initial setup, and for correlation between location information and audio playback devices. Runs on Central Server. WebApp control panel saves settings to database, while audio stream routing utilizes info in database.</p>
    <p>Audio capture and streaming for all supported source device platforms OR utilize existing audio streaming protocols common on supported platforms. Runs on Central Server.</p>
    <p>Audio stream routing. Utilizes location information and playback device correlation database to send user’s audio stream to appropriate playback device.</p>
    <p>Supplementary data collection for any data potentially relevant to decision-making. Sends data to central server for eventual decision-making. Most likely would target mobile platforms.</p>

  <h3 id="open-issues">Open Issues</h3>
  <p>Whichever audio streaming solution we choose to use will determine which platforms we will be able to support.</p>
  <p>Writing standalone apps for each platform will allow us to fully use that platform’s resources (i.e. audio stream(s), native music control), but this will introduce a good deal of complexity to the system.</p>
  <p>Writing a one-size-fits-all web app for all platforms to use will cost far less time and resources, at the expense of having less access to each platform’s resources.</p>
